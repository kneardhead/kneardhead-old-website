<p>The first time I was exposed to Linux, an Operating System, was when I googled ways to draw inkscape diagrams very quickly to take notes in real time.</p>
<p>I did hit upon a gem. The simple website where <a href="https://castel.dev">Gilles Castel</a> wrote articles on how he used LaTeX to write math in real time in the class to take notes was indeed a discovery; accompanied by Inkscape.</p>

<em>Castel&rsquo;s bspwm with nord adornment.</em></p>
<p>I was more than impressed to look at the desktop interface, I though Linux was very cool, he added what he was using, the jargons &ldquo;Ubuntu&rdquo;, &ldquo;bspwm&rdquo;, &ldquo;zathura&rdquo;.</p>
<p>My first few attempts of being cool like him was trying to install Zathura in my Windows 10 machine. I still laugh at myself what I did.</p>
<p>Long story short, one day my windows updated and went miserably slow. I was extremely afraid to change a whole operating system on the only Laptop I may ever have custody of.</p>
<p>I did it anyway. The first installation of Ubuntu from the USB stick was a complete failure, and the second installation was complete but became a mess. It was 7 in evening when I started, when I was doing the second installation it was 2 at night, shivering of cold on my dining table, mosquito&rsquo;s biting every possible inch of my arms and feet.</p>
<p>Now the pain wasn&rsquo;t enough, the screen of the computer as it booted went black and it wrote that horrible piece of text sentence, which freaked my out.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt;_ GRUB Rescue
</code></pre></div><p>The &ldquo;Grand Unified Bootloader&rdquo; was lost. It was pain, I didn&rsquo;t know anything how OS works, and here&rsquo;s this showing GRUB is not found.</p>
<p>I tried solving it, and the mosquitos continued biting. It was 3 at night when I live booted from the USB stick and finally a solution worked.</p>
<p>I finally had Linux in my system, Ubuntu. Looking back that experience had grown my curiousity and will to understand this system. Although I never felt the need to tinker with computers, using Linux and learning about it has been the way I spend my boring days in Quarantine for a year, straight.</p>
<p>One thing I love to do is finding extremely quick ways of doing things I need to do regularly. I like to Write Physics handouts and texts in LaTeX, and I wanted to do very efficiently, I like to use the word &ldquo;ergonomic&rdquo; to describe it.</p>
<p>Hence I learned doing typing, gradually increasing from 30 words per minute to 100. I installed snippets, so I can short cut to write math equations, used bspwm, which is a very minimal desktop environment that makes the windows&rsquo;s tiled.</p>
<p>I loved every part of installing these and configuring their source code to fit my needs, it&rsquo;s a thing that I love about Linux, you can make things just the way you want and know about it.</p>
<p>I am a type of guy who&rsquo;d go to a road side food truck and ask the owner &ldquo;may I make scrambled eggs in your pan?&rdquo; (I actually do this XD). Linux was a complete fit.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-system-ubuntu-2004-lts">My first system: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</h3>
<p>Initially I didn&rsquo;t know anything about it, but gradually I understood things. It was painful to go through the software github pages, but gradually I got the essense. Installing a status bar with bspwm (the window manager) called Polybar took me intense 3 days of sleep deprivation to get that working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say nobody should be wasting their time like that, but at end I had a better view of my system and understood how the nook and cranny works.</p>
<p>I was pretty happy with what I set up.</p>

<p>I am making this site from Fedora Linux, but I am now assured I want to be in Debian based systems. I will soon do my final landing on Ubuntu after I use a OpenSuse, Manjaro and Debian multiboot for a month.</p>
