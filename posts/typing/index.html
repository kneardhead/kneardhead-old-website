      <p>I started typing a year ago, from 12 words per minute (wpm) now making my goal to a 100. I feel the necessity to share what helped me.</p>
<p>First of all, I took this a bit seriously. I found it fun to track my data and fortunately had the best tools to start with. I will link the good things here with some rants.</p>
<h2 id="pre-beginner">Pre-Beginner</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ratatype.com/learn/">This</a> is the article I checked to get started.</p>
<p>These are usual rules: get a suitable keyboard layout. It&rsquo;s just a specific arrangement of the keys on the keyboard. They matter because optimized keyboard layouts try to put the most common letters nearest to the most easily reachable zones.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qwerty</strong> is the most popular but is kinda not great for typing fast, but still most fast typists use Qwerty and it&rsquo;s a default for its popularity.</li>
<li><strong>Colemak</strong> is in my opinion the modern keyboard layout, optimized yet close to Qwerty. Heres a short and good video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HNNx9IftYg">octahedron</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Workman</strong> is a good alternative and was made to solve the issues of other layouts. You have to check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2Nb9QVujgU">pinguefy</a>, no matter what layout you use, you should check the video.</li>
<li><strong>Dvorak</strong> is the somewhat old but much professional. It&rsquo;s radically different, and you will have a hard time using <code>ctrl + c,p,x,v</code> keyboard shortcuts. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOdfefV2R1I&amp;list=PLR6KC-J9ElurqF6yOZBZ0Hc5o48p55YzR">NoThisIsJohn</a> is a Dvorak user.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should use both your hands by starting your fingers aligned correctly in the <em>home row</em>. There are a lot of beginner <em>touch typing</em> tutorials to start with. It&rsquo;s always good to do a little research what you want to learn. Good starting platforms, but just keep that in mind these aren&rsquo;t built to raise you to 150 wpm marks.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ratatype.com">ratatype</a> Its a good starting place.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.typing.com">typing.com</a> Similar</li>
<li>If you are using other keyboard layouts, I&rsquo;d advice you to learn about <em>home row</em> finger placement and starting directly from <a href="https://www.keybr.com">keybr</a>. Be sure to select the right layout from the settings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="beginner">Beginner</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.keybr.com">keybr.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The method keybr uses is unique, it has an AI to train the user per letter until he reaches a certain accuracy and confidence mark. This is key to get started typing without looking at the keyboard. I spent more than 30 hours here in total and it has a great data analytics to track progress, which is really satisfying to look at.</p>
<h2 id="not-beginner">Not-Beginner</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.monkeytype.com">monkeytype</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an outcome of a idea of a person (one and only miodec), opensource, and a great community that knows what they are doing. This straight up becomes the best of the best typing website and there&rsquo;s nothing that resembles it.</p>
<p>I spend most of my time here, it&rsquo;s pretty daunting if you are beginner, I&rsquo;d never recommend this website when you are just learning, but this website is more than what is is meant to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kinda like Linux, you have everything and you can do anything. Themes to Staggered keyboard layout to funbox challenges, the unique look of a riced Arch Linux to perfectly analytical typing platform, monkeytype is the best.</p>
<p>I leave it for you to explore, I spend most of my typing time here. It still has room of development, and the community that surrounds monkeytype has taken this to a new level.</p>
<h2 id="general-rule">General rule</h2>
<p>Usually, you want follow these points,</p>
<ul>
<li>No look at the keyboard</li>
<li>Typing a word without thinking of the letters individually; purely using muscle memory.</li>
<li>Lookahead, or Readahead. If you are typing the word <em>scare</em> in a string &ldquo;scare deed done where fun&rdquo;, try to keep you eye on <em>deed</em> or <em>done</em>, have this 1 or 2 word readahead. This is key to speed because you won&rsquo;t spend time after every word reading the next one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="firstly">Firstly</h3>
<p>You type fast NOT by pecking your fingers fast, you rather type fast by keeping track of the next 1 or 2 words as you read through. This does one thing, zeroes out the time between spaces. It saves a <strong>LOT</strong> of time.</p>
<p>I mean is that if you are typing the sentence</p>
<p>&ldquo;mommy where is the honey&rdquo;</p>
<p>and you are currently typing the word &ldquo;mommy&rdquo;, you don&rsquo;t want to read &ldquo;mommy&rdquo; as you type it, rather keep your eyes on the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; which is 2 word read-ahead. If you type from thought, as I am doing now, it&rsquo;s just better to think the whole sentence before you hit the keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="secondly">Secondly</h3>
<p>Start using an alternative keyboard layout. Most people don&rsquo;t even bother to know this, but you should know that the keyboard that you are probably using is &ldquo;qwerty&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s just a particular arrangement of keys on the keyboard that has been in it&rsquo;s position for no real reason. It&rsquo;s not really great because your fingers need to travel all over the keyboard to type the letters. But still, most of the fastest typists use qwerty, but they practice it for a very long time.</p>
<p>If you are just starting, it&rsquo;s better to choose a layout, there are many others,</p>
<ul>
<li>Dvorak</li>
<li>Colemak</li>
<li>Workman</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/typing/dvorak.png" alt="Dvorak">
<em>Dvorak layout.</em></p>
<p><img src="/typing/colemak.png" alt="Colemak">
<em>Colemak layout.</em></p>
<p><img src="/typing/workman.png" alt="Workman">
<em>Workman layout, the home row is colored.</em></p>
<p>Thing is these keyboard layouts are different arrangment of keys and they place the most common English letters you type close to your stronger fingers. That means your fingers need to travel less more often that will give you an advantage, if you practice these more efficient layouts as much as qwerty-ers, I can&rsquo;t really assure there would be a very large speed benefit though, but you can type with much less pain on the fingers.</p>
<p>The wikipedia page for these layouts are amazing.</p>
<h5 id="notes-on-colemak">Notes on Colemak</h5>
<p>I have improved on Colemak pretty quickly, it&rsquo;s made easy to learn for people who already learn Qwerty. Colemak arrangements are more modern, but I always would advice you to check these layouts and study them a bit before investing your time on that. You may just stay with Qwerty which is perfectly fine, but personally I&rsquo;d be more better today if I used colemak from the first day.</p>
<h3 id="thirdly">Thirdly</h3>
<p>You really need to work on accuracy, strive for accuracy not speed.</p>
<h3 id="fourthly">Fourthly</h3>
<p>If you keep randomly typing on typeracer you&rsquo;d rather end up building up bad habits, like making the same typo over and over again. Rather your main strategy should be practice and improving it over time.</p>
<p>Your functions are dynamic, if you are just doing the same thing in the name of practice repeatedly you won&rsquo;t improve that much, you need to concious how much development you are doing.</p>
<p>Suppose you start off colemak, then you reach a 30 Words per minute in <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fkeybr.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2Xzd0if8iDJRRYV4efY4vjo8qGQtrI4PKzBmp778LHsJ561lPlrRG7RZk&amp;h=AT22YVKboF4TyjNF-zgA4LPnKZnmW5dPWZfJYk-ob8lUHbpDKJHgLNc4kUTwP2BZG07VfVdm20RAThB29vot865ukomg5iJ-hDPIvyFGjK6oVltKttT-dfEQgxrT&amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;c%5B0%5D=AT0ueHNWB8qTTSNqcIXVhu3oYyqbTKtAUid6-_rST0DcC5rbmdCQoM1MzMBXSogBxdmcUAdweKkRbCO3nXNz6uyIFCvdnvLMhEk-8-ioiCul6UjzxlXGzMbZTeVdSh4_G03DLhDpMrFZSDzCLIk">keybr.com</a> It&rsquo;s now time to improve faster, check what are you messing up very carefully, keybr has some features that makes it easier to check, but anyway, I usually face difficulty keeping in memory the position of letter &ldquo;k&rdquo;, &ldquo;y&rdquo;, &ldquo;f&rdquo;, &ldquo;j&rdquo; (which is &ldquo;n&rdquo;,&ldquo;o&rdquo;,&ldquo;e&rdquo;,&ldquo;y&rdquo; in qwerty), so I type more words that contain these letters. Don&rsquo;t go too fast, be conscious and slowly try to get that in your muscle memory.</p>
<p>It may happen your speed is stuck, like mine is stuck in 100 words per minute in qwerty (yes I started with qwerty). This happens because I am no more developing; I fully acknowledge that fact I am addicted to getting higher speeds. If I go to write some words I am trying to rush, so to prevent that, I set the monekeytype language setting to English uncommon words that forces me to type the words letter be letter, not all together in a burst. It has few good things</p>
<ul>
<li>slows the typing and focuses on accuracy</li>
<li>rewires my brain to re-memorize the letters and progress</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I am trying to be ambi-keyboard-layout-ous, which kinda means being able to type in two layouts, qwerty and colemak. It&rsquo;s not hard but requires some dedication. For instance so far I was typing in Qwerty because I can easily pull of 80 words per minute with it.</p>
<p>But let me type the next sentence in colemak for you,</p>
<p>&ldquo;this sentence was written in colemak and it took me roughly 30 seconds&rdquo;</p>
<p>But anyway, you should be dynamic and thoughtful or the process of practice. Practice with thought will reduce your efforts by a lion share and it requires some brain work so nobody talks about it.</p>
<p>Remember,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thoughtless repetition is not practice
The method is to solve your problems one by one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be aware what you invest your time on, and accept the fact you need to devise your own strategy yourself. But how you do it? Study about typing and things people do online.</p>
<h3 id="fifth">Fifth</h3>
<p>Get some humility mate, you are no way better than your peers just because you can jerk the keyboard faster, be helpful and try to do some of their typing jobs for free. Get some life, and do some volunteering, you always have takeaway. I worked with my uncle where I typed gazillion words, it did make my typing a little more consistent. Get rid of the fact working for free is bad, in initial stages your job has no monetary value.</p>
<h3 id="general-practice-method-that-works-for-me">General Practice method that works for me</h3>
<p>I did say that you should devise your own plan, but here&rsquo;s my one that you can refer to.</p>
<ul>
<li>I set the language in monkeytype hard english words (select english 5K or 450K in languages), and set custom time of 10 minutes.</li>
<li>I focus on lookahead and not making typo, even if it requires me to take a 3 second break, I won&rsquo;t commit a typo. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to avoid typo in Colemak in my opinion.</li>
<li>I kinda relax and chill, don&rsquo;t really think about the typing unless I forget the position of a key, that happens pretty often because I mostly practice colemak now.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason I set a long time is because it causes me to almost make the same typo over and over again, like pressing the word &ldquo;d&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;g&rdquo;, which is I confuse the qwerty &ldquo;g&rdquo; position with the one in Colemak. The long time forces me to relax, be frustrated about the typo, and keep a constant pace.</p>
<p>Relaxing causes cosistency, frustration causes me to think twice before hitting a key at random and pace helps me to lookahead. As a bi-product I get speed.</p>
<p>I just hit 81 wpm with colemak after doing a single session.</p>
<h2 id="if">If</h2>
<p>a descriptive page I wrote for another occasion.</p>
<p>This is the main thing you&rsquo;d need.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you are just starting out</strong>: Focus on accuracy, try to make no typo, <em>speed is the by-product of 100% accuracy</em>, it&rsquo;s hard to fight the temptation to get the maximum speeds, but usually people including me stop improving when they don&rsquo;t listen to this advice.</li>
<li><strong>If you are stuck in the 40-60 wpm range</strong>: Being stuck means small improvements compared to what you used to. It&rsquo;s a sweet spot if you just want to type for daily life. Feel free to take a month of break, at least it worked for me. Come back relaxed to see if it works out.</li>
<li><strong>If you are stuck at 80-100 wpm range</strong>: Raise the bar, an 80 is already a high speed range, and no improving means you are not being challenged. Usually people like using Pace Carets (from settings) in monkeytype, but for me, I took a break that worked. Try to increase difficulty by typing English 1K words in Monkeytype or increase word length in keybr.com. An remember, still focus on accuracy. At the moment, it&rsquo;s advisable to type slow but accurate.</li>
<li><strong>if you can&rsquo;t be relaxed</strong> Look at 3 consecutive words. Close your eyes and type them as relaxed as you can without making a mistake. This will force you to develop lookahead and muscle memory, yet not being tensed about it. If you are in the &ldquo;zone&rdquo;, the state of relaxed but accurate typing, that&rsquo;s the best. Taking very long duration timed sessions, 15-20 minutes with focus on not making typo may help too.</li>
<li><strong>if you are not accurate</strong> Give some long tests in monkeytype, after a test there&rsquo;s an option to practice misspelled or slow words, practise those words in plenty. It sucks to learn that you need to learn word by word, but if you develop the habit of typing normally in relaxed mode, the number of words that you do typo on won&rsquo;t be large.</li>
<li><strong>if you are lost</strong> then try to ponder what doesn&rsquo;t go right for you and try to devise your own practice methods. But incline to the fundamental law of,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Go slow, and lookahead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A law set by God for Human, both in typing and speedcubing.</p>
<h3 id="dark-theme">Dark theme</h3>
<p>Now if you are like me who installed linux just to get that nordic theme and uses picom to make the whole system transparent, you&rsquo;d be horrified to know most of the typing sites don&rsquo;t have a dark theme. But you can get the extension <a href="https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader">Dark Reader</a> for you browser that would force the site to take a dark theme. Works great for me.</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>To practice, try to use a very shitty keyboard, specially those in which the keys are a bit hard to press; I mean the force you need to apply to the keys is greater than normal. This will force you to be sure about clicking the right key and will raise accuracy.</p>
<p>Now in general, there&rsquo;s never a best keyboard for all, get a keyboard that you feel you love it. I typed most of my time on the laptop keyboard, it actually doesn&rsquo;t matter much if it&rsquo;s standard. I have never even seen a mechanical keyboard (let alone type on it (sad poor country resident (sad keyboard noises (3 brackets))).</p>
<h3 id="you-are-wasting-time-typing">You are wasting time typing</h3>
<p>If you are in my position that you can&rsquo;t concentrate, then it&rsquo;s time to stop overdoing typing. A solution is using <a href="https://blocksite.co/">Blocksite</a> which worked for Jashe who broke the 50 hour typing record. It&rsquo;s good to know you mustn&rsquo;t practice over half an hour a day, otherwise it&rsquo;d be detrimental. Take a break, even if it&rsquo;s a month or two if you are burned out and don&rsquo;t seem to improve that much after months.</p>

<p><strong>n-grams</strong>: For example, a very common quad-gram is <code>tion</code>, as in intersec-tion, combina-tion etc. A common bi-gram is <code>em</code>, as in em-phasis, st-em etc.</p>
<p><strong>chords</strong>: a set of letters you can type very fast, like, to type the word mountain, we have 2 chords - <em>moun</em>+<em>tain</em>. I can type <em>moun</em> and <em>tain</em> very quick together. To type <em>terminology</em>, I would do the chord <em>term</em>+<em>ino</em>+<em>logy</em>. Chords sometimes align with bigrams, but chords are not necessarily common.</p>
