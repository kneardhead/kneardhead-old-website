<h3 id="great-handouts">Great Handouts</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/mechanics/_tensor_note_sabit.pdf">Tensor and Differential Geometry</a> Describes the mathematics of coordiante systems, transformation and I will work on it when I am confident with Curved Spacetime and Field Equations. It&rsquo;s a lot of pre-study. It&rsquo;s cool because all diagrams are near exact drawn using TiKZ Language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/problems/version-8-Jan-2022.pdf">Problem Journal (8 Jan, 2022)</a> A journal I&rsquo;ve worked on for over a year, has 115 problems so far (115 out of thousands I&rsquo;ve attempted) with somewhat nicely written solutions. I am really happy about it because it is the outcome of all the things I&rsquo;ve learned from writing the handouts featured below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/mechanics/poormansLagrangian.pdf">Poorman&rsquo;s Introduction to Lagrangian Method</a> Analytical Mechanics is a fantastic way to solve physical system&rsquo;s Equation of Motion (simply said, acceleration).
$${ \mathrm{d} \over \mathrm{d} t} { \partial L \over \partial \dot{x}} ={\partial L \over \partial x}$$
By this I introduce a straightforward approach to get started using the equation to solve problems. A more in depth understanding can be got from Ashmit Dutta&rsquo;s handout, which is relatively demanding, here&rsquo;s the link in <a href="https://physoly.tech/static/files/lagrangian.pdf">physoly</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mechanics/dark_difficult_harmonics.pdf">Difficult Harmonic Oscillations</a> Mathematical solutions to various &ldquo;Difficult&rdquo; Harmonics like Forced and Damped oscillations and other general cases using the idea of a General and Particular solution - neat and nice.
$$ \ddot{x} + \omega^2 x = 0$$
The paper will look at the general case,
$$ \ddot{x} + 2\gamma \dot{x} + \omega^2 x =0 $$
Sometimes while finding modes of oscillations the matrix method is helpful, <a href="/mechanics/mech_matrix_osc_ehmet.pdf">here</a> is a quick example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mechanics/mech_com_torque_ehmet.pdf">Center of Mass derivation from Torque balance</a> Written as a part of destructively critisizing my friends mechanics tutoring online.
$$ \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \vec{\tau_i} = 0$$
That&rsquo;s the main equation, where the torque caused by all the point masses is zeroed out. We need to find the position where it happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mechanics/dark_ellipse.pdf">Ellipse from Random things</a> It&rsquo;s basically a 28 page low level research, I studied some phenomenons that yield ellipses and wrote about them here. More casual tone and informal. Starts from basic ways of drawing ellipse to the Lenz-Runge Vector. I ran into many troubles, <a href="/mechanics/elliptic_integral_cos.pdf">this</a> is one of the roadblocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mechanics/day1.pdf">Mechanics Camp 1,</a>, <a href="/mechanics/day2.pdf">2</a>, <a href="/mechanics/day3.pdf">3</a> 3 beamer I used to take the classes in Derivation Scientific Society MechMania Mechanics Camp classes. These beamers are 80-ish page long with frame snaps, and was possible becasue of Vim-Snippets and some other python codes. Looking at it now I think it was too much but I enjoyed doing it though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mechanics/banglaPhysicsGeneralMethods.pdf">General Methods (bn)</a> I can&rsquo;t explain how long it took me to type this in Bengali. Inspired by Belikov&rsquo;s book I tried writing a General Physics problem solution note, and I&rsquo;ve worked on this for countless hours. This 20 page article was typed word by word in Bengali. But interesting nobody except me has read this. I would love to hear from you if you do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/introductory/INFANTScalculus.pdf">Infant&rsquo;s Calculus</a> A 60 page introduction to Differentiation and the Integration part was discontinued. I did this to gain attention from Masruk vai and I did but get it. I discontinued the Integration part because the core problem beginners including me face/faced is the idea of approximation. Usually math texts start talking about limits, but I don&rsquo;t like that approach so I used approximation of binomials as an aid. Thanks to &ldquo;Fool&rsquo;s Guide to Calculus Book&rdquo; that finally solved some of my year long confusions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mechanics/physicsSidSol.pdf">Sidereal Time</a> I wrote my own derivation to sidereal time using angular velocity when I didn&rsquo;t understand what the other books were saying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mechanics/mech_irodov1-138_ehmet.pdf">Irodov 1.138 Mechanics</a> What&rsquo;s different about this ordinary solution note is it has 2 solutions to the same problem, using two different chain of thoughts. It is a good note to guide you how to think about a problem if you are a beginner. The 5 page note basically is my thought process when I solved it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mechanics/kin_BGD.pdf">Jaan Kalda&rsquo;s Kinematics Translation (bn)</a> It took a lot of effort to write this, and as I was in the middle I realized it was totally useless when I heard bdpho senior generation believes these problems are not core to making it to APHO/IPHO. I still don&rsquo;t understand that idea but it was enough to stop my work that time because this translation won&rsquo;t be worthwhile. But the takeaway was I had the opportunity to use the raw
LaTeX code of Jaan Kalda, it also introduced me to he idea of using custom packages (sty files) and fonts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="electromagnetism">Electromagnetism</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/electromagnetism/polarization_confustion.pdf">Introduction to Polarization</a> I found a pdf and it had a very clear introduction to Polarization. I stayed up all night noting down what I understood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/electromagnetism/maxwell-short-derive.pdf">Derivation of light from Maxwell</a> A one page derivation that took 36 minutes to type. This was a note I made after watching a video by Dr A Physics in Youtube. I can now type that thing using my Linux and Vim-Snippets within a few minutes, flex.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quantum-mechanics">Quantum Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/electromagnetism/QMnote.pdf">Normal starting note</a> Not much, if you are reading University Physics with Modern Physics edition, this note can serve as a revision. I just had fun typing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/electromagnetism/barmagnet-general-field.pdf">Bar Magnetic Field and Force</a> It&rsquo;s the beamer pdf I used to make the video for the Magnetism Playlist in Smartians of Science. The <a href="https://youtu.be/j3Jkz4jyfuw">video link</a> is here and it also features my bspwm and Nord Theme, the video was recorded using ffmpeg terminal command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thermal-physics">Thermal Physics</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="/thermal/teamseas-problem-book.pdf">TeamsSeas Problem Handout</a> Nothing great, just has some problems and ideas, written very very informally for my friends. Casually contains bad language so this is not a very great booklet but was made for a great cause. The casual register was very helpful to it&rsquo;s popularity that helped to raise a lot of money.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="introductory-physics">Introductory Physics</h3>
<p>More easy going and general kind off.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/introductory/gravitational_potential_derivation.pdf">Derivation of Gravitational Potential Energy</a> For some reason I get asked about the negative sign in front of the Gravitational Potential equation a lot, hence this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/thermal/free_time_molecule.pdf">Mean Free Path Explained</a> I used this handout to raise money for the <a href="https://teamseas.org">TeamSeas Project</a>, which was later successful raising the goal of 30M dollar for removal of 30M lb trash from the ocean. It&rsquo;s an explanation to the Mean Free Path topic in Blundell, which is not described extensively there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/introductory/binding_energy.pdf">Binding Energy of Planet</a> Basic derivation, very short.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/introductory/EscapeVelocityAgain.pdf">Escape Velocity</a> Written just to curb my enthusiasm, nothing great. It&rsquo;s one of the earliest physics concept I understood myself so it worth mentioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/introductory/juniorstartermath.pdf">Very Very Early Algebra Review</a> I was motivated to write this weirdly infant level algebra note after withnessing a Class 5 kid getting bullied by the Teacher and the his parents because of learning disabilities. It did make me sad and I wanted to do something if someone from a Class 7/8 level had the same issue with maths, hence this note - unfinished because I had to work on another book-sized note.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/introductory/bn-alg-intro.pdf">Algebra for a Class 3 kid (bn)</a> Next generation to it&rsquo;s predecessor in Bengali.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/electromagnetism/semiconductorRead.pdf">Hilly Billi Semicondcutor</a> Very short but very useful (to me) note that clarified some of my ideas, somehow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="earlier-works">Earlier Works</h3>
<p>These handouts were written when I was just starting out and I did my best imitating Jaan Kalda. Still they have some value but what mattered was writing them than the what was being written. I still go back to them if I need to review something.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/electromagnetism/ELECKTROdyn01.pdf">ELECKTROdyn01</a> I am super proud about this one, I worked on it for roughtly 4 months with high levels of satisfcation, although it&rsquo;s not a great handout. German encoding <a href="/electromagnetism/ELECTROdyn.pdf">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/electromagnetism/EM_Induction.pdf">EM_Induction</a> I thought this could be the predecessor to the last one. I was so happy about this I went to spend money to print it out of the shop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mechanics/Draft2-Mechanics1.pdf">Mass on a moving wedge</a> A standard problem, but it took me a lot of blood, sweat and tears to attempt. I couldn&rsquo;t solve it myself so I copied the solution thinking someone else is feeling the same pain as me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/introductory/MyIdeasDerPhysiks.pdf">Some Ideas and General Learnings</a> it wasn&rsquo;t unusual I was frustrated about the absence of progress. This document was an attempt to learn from my past mistakes, although I no more care that much about that much. We all grow up some day - right?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>I tried writing diagrams of science experiments I did while in grade 3 on the Windows XP machine my uncle gifted me (when it got old). It was in word, and I made my dad print it on paper, I took that piece of paper to my then science teacher who gave his ideas on the experiment.</p>
<p>I recall that experiment trying to make a sound amplifier, a carbon rod put in between two separated parts of blade connected to a small piece of mic extracted from a old piece of toy.</p>
<p>Later I wrote similar things on a Diary my dad got from his office.</p>
