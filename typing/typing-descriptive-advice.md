I will pile up important lessons I've gathered after typing for more than a year, and gaining 0 to 100 words per minute average.

## Firstly 
You type fast NOT by pecking your fingers fast, you rather type fast by keeping track of the next 1 or 2 words as you read through. This does one thing, zeroes out the time between spaces. It saves a **LOT** of time.

I mean is that if you are typing the sentence

"mommy where is the honey"

and you are currently typing the word "mommy", you don't want to read "mommy" as you type it, rather keep your eyes on the word "the" which is 2 word read-ahead. If you type from thought, as I am doing now, it's just better to think the whole sentence before you hit the keyboard.

## Secondly 
Start using an alternative keyboard layout. Most people don't even bother to know this, but you should know that the keyboard that you are probably using is "qwerty". It's just a particular arrangement of keys on the keyboard that has been in it's position for no real reason. It's not really great because your fingers need to travel all over the keyboard to type the letters. But still, most of the fastest typists use qwerty, but they practice it for a very long time.

If you are just starting, it's better to choose a layout, there are many others,

- Dvorak
- Colemak
- Workman

Thing is these keyboard layouts are different arrangment of keys and they place the most common English letters you type close to your stronger fingers. That means your fingers need to travel less more often that will give you an advantage, if you practice these more efficient layouts as much as qwerty-ers, I can't really assure there would be a very large speed benefit though, but you can type with much less pain on the fingers.

#### Notes on Colemak
I have improved on Colemak pretty quickly, it's made easy to learn for people who already learn Qwerty. Colemak arrangements are more modern, but I always would advice you to check these layouts and study them a bit before investing your time on that. You may just stay with Qwerty which is perfectly fine, but personally I'd be more better today if I used colemak from the first day.

## Thirdly
You really need to work on accuracy, strive for accuracy not speed. 


## Fourthly
If you keep randomly typing on typeracer you'd rather end up building up bad habits, like making the same typo over and over again. Rather your main strategy should be practice and improving it over time.

Your functions are dynamic, if you are just doing the same thing in the name of practice repeatedly you won't improve that much, you need to concious how much development you are doing.

Suppose you start off colemak, then you reach a 30 Words per minute in [keybr.com](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fkeybr.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2Xzd0if8iDJRRYV4efY4vjo8qGQtrI4PKzBmp778LHsJ561lPlrRG7RZk&h=AT22YVKboF4TyjNF-zgA4LPnKZnmW5dPWZfJYk-ob8lUHbpDKJHgLNc4kUTwP2BZG07VfVdm20RAThB29vot865ukomg5iJ-hDPIvyFGjK6oVltKttT-dfEQgxrT&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT0ueHNWB8qTTSNqcIXVhu3oYyqbTKtAUid6-_rST0DcC5rbmdCQoM1MzMBXSogBxdmcUAdweKkRbCO3nXNz6uyIFCvdnvLMhEk-8-ioiCul6UjzxlXGzMbZTeVdSh4_G03DLhDpMrFZSDzCLIk) It's now time to improve faster, check what are you messing up very carefully, keybr has some features that makes it easier to check, but anyway, I usually face difficulty keeping in memory the position of letter "k", "y", "f", "j" (which is "n","o","e","y" in qwerty), so I type more words that contain these letters. Don't go too fast, be conscious and slowly try to get that in your muscle memory.

It may happen your speed is stuck, like mine is stuck in 100 words per minute in qwerty (yes I started with qwerty). This happens because I am no more developing; I fully acknowledge that fact I am addicted to getting higher speeds. If I go to write some words I am trying to rush, so to prevent that, I set the monekeytype language setting to English uncommon words that forces me to type the words letter be letter, not all together in a burst. It has few good things

- slows the typing and focuses on accuracy
- rewires my brain to re-memorize the letters and progress

Now I am trying to be ambi-keyboard-layout-ous, which kinda means being able to type in two layouts, qwerty and colemak. It's not hard but requires some dedication. For instance so far I was typing in Qwerty because I can easily pull of 80 words per minute with it.

But let me type the next sentence in colemak for you,

"this sentence was written in colemak and it took me roughly 30 seconds"

But anyway, you should be dynamic and thoughtful or the process of practice. Practice with thought will reduce your efforts by a lion share and it requires some brain work so nobody talks about it.

Remember,

> Thoughtless repetition is not practice
> The method is to solve your problems one by one.

Be aware what you invest your time on, and accept the fact you need to devise your own strategy yourself. But how you do it? Study about typing and things people do online.

## Fifth 
Get some humility mate, you are no way better than your peers just because you can jerk the keyboard faster, be helpful and try to do some of their typing jobs for free. Get some life, and do some volunteering, you always have takeaway. I worked with my uncle where I typed gazillion words, it did make my typing a little more consistent. Get rid of the fact working for free is bad, in initial stages your job has no monetary value.
