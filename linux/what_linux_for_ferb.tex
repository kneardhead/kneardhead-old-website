\textbf{Linux} is just a kernel, and with Kernel needs an extension. Various people has added various additions to the Kernel to make it a full \textbf{Operating System}. Here are some of my best suggestions, as you have set up a virtual box and checking distro's is a very fun past time. 

\section{Ubuntu}
I use it. I use it daily and I loved it. It's nice and has optimal company support. Many might dislike it, but it's fine for me. 

It is stable, solid and works without any problem in my device. It is \textbf{Debian} based so the commands are relatively well known. 

Nice, has a good software collection in \textbf{Ubuntu Software}. 

It's slogan is basically ``Linux for Humans". Comes with required things and works from the first day without any problem. 

I can use \textbf{BSPWM} and \textbf{Gnome Desktop} when needed. Nice one, I won't be changing the Distro anyway soon. 

Everything is cool about Ubuntu. Looking forward to October release with  \textbf{Gnome Desktop 40} which is a love at first sight for me.


\section{ Fedora}   
Fedora is used by the Dads and Fathers of Linux so not gonna lie it's a yes. 

Has a Virtual Box pre installed that makes it solid. Already comes with  \textbf{Gnome 40} so you don't need to wait anyway. 

Kind of Ubuntu, but is completely maintained by a Community (not like Canonical of Ubuntu). 

Fedora uses $dnf$ which is little different than Ubuntu, neither Fedora is Debian so a little different commands needed, but not a big matter tho. 

Fedora would be the Distro I'd like to try if possible (in some old machine).

\section{ Lubuntu}
The Ubuntu for old pc's. And has a Windows like Window manager, which is nice anyway. 

Lubuntu  makes old device alive like newborn (if installed properly xD).


\section{ Garuda Linux}
Used for Gaming and is arch based. So you gotta admit this kid is super fast, super powerful yet easy to install. 

Garuda has a cool nitro theme to it, which makes it another level linux. 

Highly recommended to try once in Virtual box.
