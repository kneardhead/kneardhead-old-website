# Method to know what you are doing in Physics

> If you ever thought that yeah, I wanna study physics too, but then become confused what you are doing with your life, I have been thinking of a solution to this problem for a few days. 

You are playing a game. But the game is a new release and you have no idea what challenges are in front. 

The game is going on pretty quick and you are trying to wrap around your head against that massive obstacle. You are trying to focus very high because you really want to go through it, but let me tell you a secret, you don't really have an idea what to do. 

Playing Counter Strike and looking at tutorials, one thing the dudes always told was knowing the map. And it's true, I used to watch gameplays, there most of the professional kids would start by throwing Molotovs or Grenades at a doorway, almost every time. They know where this way goes, where that doorway leads to, all those sorts of stuffs before hand. 

But what if you don't? What if it's some real life situation where you have to escape a prison, a prison of which you have no idea what the exterior region looks like? 

You need to escape by observing each and every part of the moves you do, check if there's some guard randomly popping up, check if you are under the survillence camera. 

You need to think in every steps of the movement. 

We fear when we don't know what's coming up, we as humans, want an estimation of what may happen. That goes for gaming, knowing the playzone correctly, before hand. And also for escaping prisons, knowing the time stamps when the guard will walk over the hallway. 

We don't want to be at unknown situations, that's our nature, we have to know the outcome when we are doing something, we have to have an aim.

Well, doing physics often I am not aware about that. 

I start of thinking, yeah, I'd read this topic and learn why Blundell is saying Parition Function is epic, yet, 2 pages into it, I am bored and devastated, I have no idea what's going on. 

Let me tell you one thing, You never want to be in a situation when you don't know what you are doing. 

You really want to start with the uses, I'd really want to know why the Partition function is there in the place before hand.

Most of us actually like examples more than the theory of a physics book. This makes a ridicolous level of sense, why? Because examples are a way to peek at the usage of a theory. And that's crucial to anything. Nobody would learn something if it doesn't have an appeal to real world. 

There is always use. Even something useless theory's use is being "useless", it's useful in a way of being "useless", that's the point. 

Partition function, yes, I have no idea about it. The correct way to know what it really does is checking out some problems at the end of the theory book.
